This project implements a complete MERN-based workflow for analyzing social media content extracted from documents. The backend is built using Node.js and Express with CommonJS modules for maximum compatibility. File uploads are handled using Multer. For text extraction, the project uses pdf-parse for PDF documents and Tesseract.js for image-based OCR. After the text is extracted, a lightweight rule-based engine evaluates the content for engagement quality and generates recommendations such as adding hashtags, limiting text length, improving call-to-action phrasing, and using emojis.

The frontend uses React with Vite for fast development and rendering performance. It includes a drag-and-drop upload area, loading indicators, error states, and clean content display sections for extracted text and engagement suggestions. Axios is used for communication with the backend. The entire application is deployable using Render for backend and Vercel for frontend, with environment variables controlling the API endpoints. The solution is modular, simple, and production-ready within the given 8-hour assignment limit.
